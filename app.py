    Plastic Bottles: Hanging Planters / Herb Garden: Cut large soda bottles horizontally or vertically. Puncture drainage holes, decorate the outside, and hang them by string or wire to create a space-saving wall garden.

Bottle Bottoms: Flower Decorations:	Cut off the rigid, patterned bottoms of large soda bottles, paint them bright colours, and string them together to create garlands, wind chimes, or faux flowers.

Lotion/Shampoo Bottles:	Charging Phone Holder:	Cut a slot in the back of an empty, clean bottle (near the neck) to hang over an electrical adapter while the phone rests in the body of the bottle during charging.

Plastic Lids/Caps:	Mosaic Art/Play Mat:	Glue colourful plastic caps onto a piece of plywood or cardboard to create a textured mosaic for decoration or a sensory mat for kids.''',

Cereal Boxes: Magazine or File Holders	: Cut the box diagonally from one corner to the opposite side to create a stylish slanted holder. Cover with decorative paper, fabric, or paint.

Toilet Paper / Paper Towel Rolls:	Cord Organizers:	Insert coiled power cords or extension cords into the tubes to keep them untangled in a drawer. Label the outside of the tube with the cord's use or length.

Shoeboxes:	Decorative Storage Boxes:	Cover the boxes with wallpaper, contact paper, or paint. Use them to store photos, craft supplies, office clutter, or socks.

Egg Cartons (Cardboard):	Seed Starter Trays:	Fill the cups with soil and seeds. Once the seedlings are ready, you can often tear off the individual cup and plant it directly into the ground, as the cardboard will biodegrade''',
